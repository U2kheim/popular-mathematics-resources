# Popular Mathematics Resources

A curated list of popular mathematics resources (websites, podcasts, books, games etc.) intended to support a scientific publication.

This repository contains:
- `index.html` — an interactive, filterable page that reads the CSV and renders the table.
- `data/resources.csv` — the data CSV (edit this to update the list).
- (Optional) `LICENSE`, `CITATION.cff` — recommended for sharing and citation.

Quick links
- View source: https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
- Live site (after enabling Pages): https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

How to update the list
1. Open `data/resources.csv` in this repository (click the file, then the pencil ✏️ icon).
2. Edit rows or paste CSV content exported from Excel.
   - Required headers (case-sensitive): `Resource,Type,Topic,Description,Link`
   - Extra columns are allowed and will appear in the table.
3. Commit changes directly to `main` (or create a branch + PR if you prefer).

If you prefer to edit locally:
- Export your Excel as CSV, then upload via Add file → Upload files, or push with Git.

How to publish (enable GitHub Pages)
1. Ensure `index.html` and `data/resources.csv` are committed to the default branch (usually `main`).
2. In the repository, go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under "Source", choose "Deploy from a branch", pick the branch (e.g., `main`) and folder `/ (root)`, then click Save.
4. GitHub will show the published URL; wait a minute for it to build.

Suggested citation (for your paper)
- Please cite this repository or dataset as:
  - Your Name (Year). "Popular Mathematics Resources" (GitHub repository). URL: https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>

Recommended additional files
- `LICENSE` — choose a license for the data and code. For datasets, consider a data-friendly license (e.g., CC BY 4.0). For code, MIT or BSD are common.
- `CITATION.cff` — a short file to indicate how to cite the repo; GitHub surfaces this to visitors.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — brief instructions for external contributions (optional).

Privacy / visibility
- If you intend to share the link in a paper, make the repository public (Settings → General → Change repository visibility).
- If the repo is private and you still want GitHub Pages publicly accessible, there can be extra settings depending on account/org — easiest is to make it public.

Need help customizing?
- I can customize this README with your paper citation, repository URL, or preferred license. Paste the text you want in the citation and I’ll produce a tailored README (ready to paste).
- Or, if you want, paste the repo URL and I can check the Pages settings and tell you the exact published URL.

Would you like me to customize the README with your citation and repo name now?
